# Docker Logging

```
none	    No logs are available for the container and docker logs does not return any output.
local	    Logs are stored in a custom format designed for minimal overhead.
json-file	[DEFAULT] The logs are formatted as JSON. The default logging driver for Docker.
syslog	    Writes logging messages to the syslog facility. The syslog daemon must be running on the host machine.
journald	Writes log messages to journald. The journald daemon must be running on the host machine.
gelf	    Writes log messages to a Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) endpoint such as Graylog or Logstash.
fluentd	    Writes log messages to fluentd (forward input). The fluentd daemon must be running on the host machine.
awslogs	    Writes log messages to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
splunk	    Writes log messages to splunk using the HTTP Event Collector.
etwlogs 	Writes log messages as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events. Only available on Windows platforms.
gcplogs	    Writes log messages to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Logging.

 - `docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}' CONTAINER`

```sh
docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'
docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}' CONTAINER

## 도커 로깅에 대하여 조심해야할 점

기본 드라이버 설정인 `json-file`은 로테이션을 하지 않으며 디스크 공간 고갈을 조심해야 한다.

Tip: use the local logging driver to prevent disk-exhaustion

By default, no log-rotation is performed. As a result, log-files stored by the default json-file logging driver logging driver can cause a significant amount of disk space to be used for containers that generate much output, which can lead to disk space exhaustion.

Docker keeps the json-file logging driver (without log-rotation) as a default to remain backward compatibility with older versions of Docker, and for situations where Docker is used as runtime for Kubernetes.

For other situations, the local logging driver is recommended as it performs log-rotation by default, and uses a more efficient file format. Refer to the Configure the default logging driver section below to learn how to configure the local logging driver as a default, and the local file logging driver page for more details about the local logging driver.
```

아래와 같이 설정해서 log-rotation을 설정하자

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml 예시

services:
  mymymy:
    image: mymymy
    container_name: mymymy
    logging:
      driver: "local"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```
